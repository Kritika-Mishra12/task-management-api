# Task Management API

## Overview
This is a Task Management API that allows users to create, update, delete, and fetch tasks. The API includes authentication and authorization, ensuring users can only manage their own tasks unless they have an admin role. Additionally, it supports filtering, sorting, and pagination for both users and tasks.

## Features
- User Registration & Login with password hashing
- JWT-based Authentication
- Role-based Access Control (Admin & Non-Admin Users)
- Task Management (CRUD operations)
- User Management (Admin-specific CRUD operations)
- Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination for Users & Tasks

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- dotenv for environment variables

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/task-management-api.git
   cd task-management-api
   
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a .env file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     PORT=3001
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

4. Start the server:
   npm run dev
